Hi! I'm Junlin Liu (刘俊麟).
I am currently a graduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/) (CASIA), and the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) (UCAS).

My research interests include reinforcement learning, large language models and multi-agent cooperation and games. I am particularly interested in evaluating and improving the reasoning capabilities of foundation models, with a focus on challenging mathematical and general reasoning.
