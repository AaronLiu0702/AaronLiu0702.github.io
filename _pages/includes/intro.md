Hi! I'm Junlin Liu (刘俊麟).
I am currently a graduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS).

My research interests include reinforcement learning, large language models and multi-agent cooperation and games. I am particularly interested in evaluating and improving the reasoning capabilities of foundation models, with a focus on challenging mathematical reasoning and general reasoning.
